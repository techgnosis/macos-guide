the included terminal, `Terminal.app`, is usually replaced by iTerm2 right away. `Terminal.app` is like Internet Explorer or Edge. It gets used to download its replacement and that's about it.

But, I have a soft spot for included software. For some reason I like using what comes out of the box. Terminal.app is just fine.
