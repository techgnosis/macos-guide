You can install homebrew anywhere. You are not limited to the default `/opt/homebrew` which requires Administrator permissions during install. It is very unsupported, however, and they make that very clear on their site. Despite that, I have had very minimal issues. Give it a shot. It's simple, just follow the docs

glow - markdown preview in the console. its awesome
gettext - that's how you get envsubst
